# co-iot
Context Ontology for IoT, CO-IoT defines a more abstract, generic and overarching vocabulary for context-aware IoT ecosystem by considering various context dimensions.
We use a three-level hierarchical approach for designing CO-IoT which is as follows:
Upper-level ontology: This represents a more abstract level consisting of core ontology and task ontology. (i) Core ontology provides a basic taxonomy that captures high-level concepts about the general context in an IoT ecosystem and (ii) Task ontology characterizes the problem-solving structure of the domain and provides primitives for describing the problem-solving process. 
Middle-level ontology: To incorporate the diverse domain knowledge separately with the upper ontology, the middle-level is introduced. This modular level is called Domain ontology that consolidates all the ontological concepts that distinguish the domain knowledge thereby providing ease of ontological resource reuse. 
Lower-level ontology: This layer is called Application ontology that provides concepts that are application-specific.
